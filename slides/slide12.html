        <p class="text-lg text-left">
          First, we ignore the 3D geometry and focus only on the <strong>topology</strong>â€”which atoms are connected to which. We can represent the molecule as a "flattened" 2D network graph.

        <p class="text-lg text-left mt-4">
          This view makes it easier to plan a path that visits every atom, which is the key to writing a linear SMILES string. In cubane, every carbon is connected to three others.

    <p><strong>Narration:</strong> The first step is to simplify our perspective. Instead of thinking about the molecule in 3D, we'll look at it as a flat, two-dimensional graph. This topological view shows us only the essential information needed for SMILES: the atoms and their bonds. This makes it much easier to plan a path that visits every single atom.</p>
