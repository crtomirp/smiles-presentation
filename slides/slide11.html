    <p><strong>Narration:</strong> Let's tackle a more complex molecule: Cubane. As you can see, it's a three-dimensional cage, with its eight carbon atoms arranged at the corners of a cube. The challenge is to convert this complex 3D shape into a simple, linear text string that accurately represents its atomic connections. This process will test our understanding of ring closures and branching.</p>
